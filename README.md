# BootstrapRistoranteConFusion

## Necessary Software
I used visual studio code to make this website but any editor should work. If you download the files you will need the node modules to run the site. So navigate to the directory of where you saved index.html and then run 

<pre>npm install</pre>

After that run

<pre>npm start</pre>

and the site will launch.

## Demo
A demo of the website can be seen at https://youtu.be/REzNZXrCMgE.

Note that there is no audio it is just a quick video to show the site in action.

## Description
